PyShield 
PyShield is a powerful Python-based security analysis tool designed to enhance the security and code quality of your projects hosted on GitHub repositories. By scanning your codebase, PyShield identifies potential vulnerabilities and issues, helping you ensure that your software is secure and reliable.


Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up Your GitHub Token
Step 1: Generating Your GitHub Token

Log in to GitHub:

Go to GitHub and sign in with your account.
Access Token Settings:

Click on your profile picture in the top right corner.
Select “Settings” from the dropdown menu.
On the settings page, find and click on “Developer settings”.
In the developer settings, choose “Personal access tokens”.
Create New Token:

Click on the “Generate new token” button.
Give your token a descriptive name under “Note” (e.g., “PyShield Access Token”).
Select Scopes:

Choose the scopes or permissions you want to grant this token. For PyShield, select at least repo, which allows access to private repositories.
For public repositories, public_repo access is sufficient.
Generate Token:

Click the “Generate token” button at the bottom of the page.
Copy Your New Token:

Important: Copy your new personal access token now. You won’t be able to see it again!
Step 2: Configuring PyShield with Your GitHub Token

Create a Configuration File:

In the root directory of PyShield, create a file named config.json.
Add Token to Configuration:

Edit config.json and add your GitHub token in the following format:
json
Copy code
{
  "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your_github_token_here"
}
Replace your_github_token_here with the token you copied from GitHub.
Save and Close the File:

Save the changes to config.json.
Step 3: Using PyShield

With the token set up, you can now use PyShield to scan repositories from GitHub.
Open PyShield and proceed with repository scanning as needed.

Keep your GitHub token secure. Treat it like a password, and do not share it.
If you believe your token has been compromised, revoke it immediately on GitHub and generate a new one.
